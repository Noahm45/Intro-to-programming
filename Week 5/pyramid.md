## pyramid

  **What I tried and didn't work**
  - At first I tried to change the numbers. and the info i got from changing the i < x and the j < x was that the i was the y axis and the j was the x axis. And negatives in the i = -x or j = -x would only add more because of the starting point is further away from the end point. And you can't put negatives in the i < -x or j < -x because you can't print negative # 
  - Then I tried to make more sub nests. And that really didn't work i got all kinds of wacky results.

  **What i tried that started/did work**
  - I the reread the assignment hints and realized that at most i was suppose to change a few things in the code and not write more code.
  - I then realized that the i and j are also variables. And I tried my luck at making j = i and i got a pyramid but it was a little to thick and upside down.
  - I then messed with the i < x and j < x until i got the thickness of the pyramid i wanted to get.
  - When I got to this point i left the class room and on my walk how I was trying to think of a way to invert the pyramid. Then it dawned on me. if i put a - in front of the i in j = i it would invert the I variable thus making the pyramid stand up properly.
