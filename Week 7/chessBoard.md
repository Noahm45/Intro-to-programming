#chessBoard

- The pseudo code for this really helped me order things correctly and not forget it. i knew i was going to have to divide the board size because  # and a space was going to have to be 1 full unit.
- This was a lot harder than i originally thought, but it wasn't to hard. i understand almost all of it the code and how it operates.
- in one of my code trials i got a series of true and false statements. I was able to fix this by adding a conditional '? and :' with ture being a space and false being a # . 
which then printed the correct board. (if you could please go over why i got a series of true false statements that would be greatly appreciated.)

- Another issue i had was where to place the new line that didn't take me so long to figure out once i realized it was because of where it was in the process and where it was with in the brackets.



#code I used/referenced
- I didn't really copy any code but i used my week 5 C pyramid code as a slight reference because i knew that it low key printed a chessboard already.

- My reference was just to set up the (i = 0; i < size; i++)

- This reference can be found at from Noahm45/Intro-to-programming/Week 5/pyramid.c

- I also referenced code for my prompt section of my code. the external code that wasn't mine that I referenced was

'let num = Number(prompt("Pick a number between 1 and 12"));

if (num < 3) {
  console.log ("Costard");
} else if (num < 6) {
  console.log ("Dogberry");
} else if (num < 8) {
  console.log ("Falstaff");
} else if (num < 10) {
  console.log ("Feste");
} else {
    console.log ("Puck")
}'
