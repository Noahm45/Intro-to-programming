# GitHub trolling

This was an interesting activity especially since i had no idea what the full code looked like. However seeing all the changes did give me a good sense of what it could of looked like and how big it was (51,000+)

I was surprised at how many lines it got up to in the edits.
I noticed most of the edits were to either the references, project item, imports, case, and some if then statements.
It was mainly one person who was making the commits, how ever one different person made a few commits however they were smaller commits.
Some of the commit titles don't make since from outside looking in. however the ones that are clearly named tell you exactly what aspect of the coding they changed. such as "Position. BuyOrdersCount, SellOrdersCount, BuyOrdersMargin, SellOrderâ€¦"

Over all I learned that there are different parts to a stock trading algorithm. Such as the core and the master. How big they really are in terms of lines of code. And how much file management you need. And most importantly YOU NEED LEGIBLE CODE.
